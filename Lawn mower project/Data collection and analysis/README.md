In this code, Person I collected data on the sound characteristics of a lawn mower, analyzing the data, and calculating the sound reduction levels needed for the simulation.

First, the collected data points are plotted using plt.plot(), with markers representing the data points. The x-axis is labeled as "Distance (m)" using plt.xlabel(), and the y-axis is labeled as "Sound Intensity (dB)" using plt.ylabel(). A title is added to the plot using plt.title(). Grid lines are enabled with plt.grid(True) to aid visualization. Finally, the plot is displayed using plt.show().

Next, the code calculates the sound reduction levels by subtracting each sound intensity from the maximum sound intensity using a list comprehension. The reduction levels are then displayed using a loop, showing the distance and the corresponding reduction level.
